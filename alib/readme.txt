This is the utility library supporting the CSVfix program. Note that not
all functionality is used by CSVfix, and it could usefully be pruned.

The library is written by Neil Butterworth.

Unfortunately there is only an [archived repo](https://code.google.com/archive/p/csvfix)
on Google Code, that does not compile on Linux or OSX. That repository points to a
successiv [repo on Bitbucket](http://neilb.bitbucket.org/csvfix) - but that one os
dead. Neil seems not to be on Github.

However, there is a newer tarball [version 1.6](https://sourceforge.net/projects/csvfix/)
on Sourceforge by [Pedro Albanese](https://sourceforge.net/u/pedroalbanese/profile/).

Unfortunately [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) does not find that. So the idea for this
repository here is to provide a current source release and to link
Homebrew to it.
